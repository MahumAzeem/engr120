_Prototype of the robot._

This robot was a project for the course 'Engineering 120' at the University of Victoria. I was in charge of the software for this project and posted the source code for this robot here. The project handout may be under the ownership of the univserity so I will withhold posting them here. If there are any questions please email me.

## Features
- Finite State Machine
- Infrared Pulse scanning to locate the target object
- Anit-reflection strategy to avoid the IR bouncing off the walls of the arena


## Issues
- Captured unreliable data if the source of IR was too far
- Confused the natural IR present in the room with the IR signal if the signal was weak
- No fallback system present
